QUESTION:

Obtain the extension of the file. Define a new attribute in the class named file_entity that depending of the extension of the file instances a FileCSV class or a FileTXT class. Use a function called get_lines to read each line of the file_entity and store it in a variable called data.  Define a new attribute in the class named graph that using the variable data instances a Graph class. Do not use os or sys libraries


class RouteDomain():


Use Call-Based Format

ANSWER:
class RouteDomain():

	def __init__(self):
		self.routes = {}

	def get_lines(self, extension):
		return zip(*[iter(self.routes[f]) for f in self.routes.get(extension, [])]).split('\n')

	def file_entity(self, extension):
		return get_lines(extension).pop()

	def graph(self, extension):
		return get_lines(extension).pop()


rdomain = RouteDomain()
rdomain.graph.set('.xls'.split('.'))
rdomain.file_entity.set('.')
<|endoftext|>
